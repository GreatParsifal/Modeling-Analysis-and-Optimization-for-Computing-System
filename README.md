# Modeling-Analysis-and-Optimization-for-Computing-System

Complex computing systems, such as integrated circuits, require fundamental modeling, analysis, and optimization techniques. 

This course introduces the methods and basic tools for designing complex systems by using integrated circuits as an example. 

It will cover the following topics:
- Modeling techniques (discrete system, synchronous and asynchronous systems, automata)
- Optimization techniques (linear programming, integer linear programming, SAT, SMT)
- Analysis techniques (modeling checking, equivalence checking)

The lab part of this course will introduce how to use the state-of-the-art tools. 

This course will be covered in both Chinese and English. 

This course covers the interdisciplinary area between design automation, embedded system design, and computer system design. 

It will be useful for students to deeply understand computer hardware and software, solve practical problems using algorithms, and build practical systems.
