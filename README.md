# Modeling-Analysis-and-Optimization-for-Computing-System
	Complex computing system such as integrated circuits requires fundamental modeling, analysis, and optimization techniques. This course introduces the methods and basic tools for designing complex systems by using integrated circuits as an example. It will cover the following topics including modeling techniques (discrete system, synchronous and asynchronous systems, automata), optimization techniques (linear programming, integer linear programming, SAT, SMT), analysis technique (modeling checking, equivalence checking). The lab part of this course will introduce how to use the state-of-the-arts tools. This course will be covered in both Chinese and English. This course covers interdisciplinary area between design automation, embedded system design, computer system design. It will be useful for students to deeply understand computer hardware and software, solve practical problems using algorithms, and build practical system.
